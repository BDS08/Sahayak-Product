<p align="left"> Sahayak is an online helping platform for any student, it can be used just by going into
Sahayak's website and clicking on the service option then you'll be provided there with two other
options: "upload items" and "get items". If you have any items regarding academics which could
be useful for any fellow student, then you can upload your items with item's details by clicking
on upload items and if you want to get or you're in need of any item, you can click on get items
and there you can find many items regarding academics of which you can simply click on any
specific item you want and you can get it. Sahayak works accordingly which would be beneficial
for many students.</p>
